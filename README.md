# Habit-Tracker
I developed a Habit Tracker application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to help users manage and track their personal habits. The app features real-time updates through JavaScript, so users can see their progress immediately. I used local storage to ensure that habit data is saved across sessions, even if the page is refreshed. The design is responsive, meaning it looks great on all devices, thanks to CSS. Users can track their habit progress visually with dynamic progress bars that update as they complete tasks. The application also calculates and displays the number of days each habit has been tracked, giving users detailed insights into their progress. I made sure that all user inputs are validated to prevent errors and ensure accurate data entry
